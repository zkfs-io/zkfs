# Quick start

```zsh
// make sure to configure your build environment as described below
npm i --save @zkfs/contract-api@latest
```

üö® **You will have to configure your build environment to resolve some of the relative imports temporarily used within ZKFS libraries, you can [find out how and why in this issue](https://github.com/zkfs-io/zkfs/issues/57).**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è ZKFS is currently being shipped as a development preview, containing a limited subset of features. As of now, you can use ZKFS in your test suite using @zkfs/contract-api@latest. Next step is to ship a UI development kit, with a fully fledged ZKFS node/peer.

```typescript

import { method, UInt64 } from 'snarkyjs';
import {
  offchainState,
  OffchainStateContract,
  OffchainState,
} from '@zkfs/contract-api';

class Counter extends OffchainStateContract {
  @offchainState() public count = OffchainState.fromRoot<UInt64>(UInt64);

  public init() {
    super.init();
    this.count.set(UInt64.from(0));
  }

  @method
  public update() {
    const currentCount = this.count.get();
    const newCount = currentCount.add(1);
    this.count.set(newCount);
  }
}
```

# Contributing

When contributing, please keep the following in mind:

- Use the [`git flow`](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) convention for branch names:
  - `feature/*`
    - Feature branches shall be created only for corresponding issues and named accordingly, such as `feature/#1-development-release-workflow`
  - `develop`
  - `release/<package-name>@<version>` .e.g.: `release/@zkfs/sdk-test@0.0.1`
    - Alternatively, in case of a multi package release, feel free to use an arbitrary release name (release/\*)
- Follow [`commitizen's conventional-changelog`](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) commit message format
  - Use `npm run commit` and you'll be presented with a commitizen prompt walking you through writing the commit message properly.
- Each pull request for the develop branch must pass the underlying workflows for lint/test/build.
- There are a few git hooks configured to help you validate commit contents before pushing:
  - `pre-commit`: validates staged files
  - `pre-push`: validates branch names
- Releases and changelog generation shall happen after merging from `release/*` to `develop`
  - Changelog and semver increments are generated automatically from conventional commits. All commits are included together with a merge commit, so that the changelog and semver can be deducted automatically.
  - Releases happen automatically on merge to develop (@alpha releases)

## Issue tracking / Github project

You can keep track of the work being done across all ZKFS repositories in the [ZKFS Github project](https://github.com/orgs/zkfs-io/projects/2).

## Local CI workflow

In order to run github workflows locally, you need to install [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act). This is especially useful when developing changes to the CI/CD pipeline. Afterwards you should be able to run the following:

```zsh
# run all workflows tied to pull_request(s)
act pull_request
```
